    <div class="text"><p>
            Hi there! As a web designer, my main focus is on creating visually appealing, functional and user-friendly websites.
            I have a strong passion for design and I love the creative process of turning an idea into a tangible website.
        </p>
        <p>
            My skillset includes proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other programming languages.
            I have experience in both front-end and back-end web development, and I am constantly learning new techniques and
            technologies to keep up with the ever-evolving web design industry.
        </p>
        <p>
            I understand the importance of creating websites that not only look good but also perform well in terms of loading speed,
            responsiveness, and accessibility. I am also well-versed in user experience (UX) design principles and always strive to create websites
            that are intuitive and easy to navigate.
        </p>
